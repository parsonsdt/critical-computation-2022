    <h2>Lost and Found</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      Draw a memory of an object described to you in plain language through
      code.
    </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      We remember the past through words and images. Oftentimes when we describe
      our memories to our friends, our spoken words construct an image in their
      mind. This image is an interpretation of our memories and inevitably will
      look very different from the image in our mind. This is because unlike a
      computer programming language, the human language is spectacularly
      ambiguous. It is always approximate and never fully accurate.
    </p>
    <p>For example, to describe a smiley face:</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Human Language</summary>
      <p>The person is looking straight ahead and carrying a smile.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Computer Language</summary>
      <code>
        noFill();<br />
        strokeWeight(4);<br />
        stroke(0);<br />
        ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);<br />
        arc(200, 215, 33, 30, 0, PI);<br />
        fill(0);<br />
        ellipse(180, 190, 10, 10);<br />
        ellipse(220, 190, 10, 10);<br
      /></code>
    </details>

    <p>
      Assignment 1 explores this ambiguity in human language as well as the gap
      between human language and computer language. Completed in pairs of two,
      you will work with a partner and exchange a detailed description (a
      memory) of a personal object you have lost in the past. Then based on the
      description, you will create an image of the object for your partner in
      p5.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depiction of the object does not need to be an exact representation.
      (In fact, this will likely be impossible.) The end result will be a
      combination of how the memory of the object is described to you, your
      interpretation of what that object looks like, and how you are able to
      render the object through code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assessment of the assignment is not dependent on the work your partner
      completes. Your work will be evaluated based on the code you produce and
      reflections you write.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Part 1 : DUE 9/2 (BFADT section B DUE: 9/1)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose an object you have lost in the past that has meaning to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Describe your memory of the object using plain language. It is up to you
        how much detail you impart, but be mindful of your own assumptions about
        what your partner might know about the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be prepared to share your written description in CC Lab on 9/2 & 9/1
        (for BFADT section B) where you will be paired with a partner. Be ready
        to discuss any questions you may have about the next part of the
        assignment.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Part 2: DUE 9/12 (deadline extended: Labor Day)</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Share your description (without any reference images) with your assigned
        partner.
      </li>
      <li>
        After exchanging descriptions, begin drawing that image on a piece of
        paper. Then transfer the drawing in pseudocode. Be sure to include the
        following technical components in your sketch:
        <ul>
          <li>2D primitives</li>
          <li>fill() and blendMode()</li>
          <li>Translate(), Rotate(), Push(), Pop()</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Be sure to include the following information on your CC Portfolio
        Assignment #1 page:
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">Your p5 sketch (embedded iframe)</li>
          <li class="bullet">Your name</li>
          <li class="bullet">Your partner’s name</li>
          <li class="bullet">The object description you received</li>
          <li class="bullet">Your assignment reflections</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Reflect upon the following:
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">
            The language your partner used to describe the image
          </li>
          <li class="bullet">Your interpretation of the image</li>
          <li class="bullet">The depiction of the image using code</li>
          <li class="bullet">
            The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Please submit your sketch to two places:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Submit the sketch to the CC Lab class Canvas Assignment 1</li>
      <li>Add the sketch to your Critical Computation portfolio</li>
    </ol>
