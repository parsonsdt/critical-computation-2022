    <h2>Data Portrait</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Create a data portrait out of a personal habit of yours.
      </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        For Assignment 6, you will spend a week tracking a personal habit of yours to create a data-self portrait. Choose the personal habit mindfully — you will need to collect 20 ~ 50 data points for this assignment. Record the data onto a numbered list every time it happens, and translate the list into array in p5.js. Animate your data self-portrait using any of the programming concepts you’ve learned in this class. Include an instruction on your CC portfolio to teach your audience how to read your data self-portrait.
      </p>

    <h3>Design Constraint</h3>

    <p>Canvas Size: 600 x 600</p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Part 1 : DUE 10/14 (Yerba Buena section DUE: 10/13)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> Decide what kind of data you’d like to track, and collect two days worth of data in the form of a numbered list.
          Be prepared to share this in CC Lab. </li>
        <li> Present your idea & data in CC Lab, and translate your numbered list into an array during class. </li>
      </ol>

    <h4>Part 2: DUE 10/20 (Yerba Buena section DUE: 10/19)</h4>

      <ol>
        <li> Once you have gathered seven days worth of data, animate your data portrait using any programming concepts you’ve
          learned in CC. </li>
        <ul> On your CC portfolio page, please include the following: <li> A description of your Data Portrait.
            What was the personal habit you were trying to track? </li>
          <li> An instruction for the viewers on how to read your data portrait. </li>
          <li> Describe your design process. Include your numbered list and any other sketches or images that
            would help us better understand your process. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> Your overall reflection on the assignment: <li> What did you learn about yourself through the
            process of self-tracking? </li>
          <li> What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization? </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Please submit your sketch to two places:</p>
    <ol>
